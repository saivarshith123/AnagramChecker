# Anagram Checker

## Description
The Anagram Checker is a simple web application that allows users to check if two words are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase that is created by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, "listen" is an anagram of "silent".

## How It Works

1. **Set Budget**
   - Enter the total budget in the input field labeled "Budget" and click the "Set Budget" button.
   - The app validates the input to ensure it is not empty or negative.
   - Once set, the total budget and balance are displayed.

2. **Add Expenses**
   - Enter the product title and its cost in the "Expenses" section.
   - Click the "Check Amount" button to add the expense to the list.
   - The app updates the total expenses and remaining balance accordingly.

3. **Modify or Delete Expenses**
   - You can edit or delete an expense from the list.
   - Editing restores the expense values to the input fields, allowing you to modify and resubmit them.
   - Deleting an expense updates the total expenses and balance.
